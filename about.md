*By: 我是苏素*

Synopsis: 

"Anecdotes of a Lady Chef" is the honest tale of a crazy lady chef and reserved imperial chef, a crafty prince and idiot girl. The Lin family's daughter, Wuniao,  time traveled into the internal strife to become the champion of chefs just as she was cooking some noodles. She then made noodles with the brilliant prince and imperial chef.

Lin Wu Niao was blind in the kitchen and had no ambition. Despite being born to a noble family of chefs, neither her legs nor her arms were diligent in practicing. Rather, too lazy to practice cooking, she was only skilled in the art of cooking instant noodles.

By chance, because she was cooking instant noodles, the pressure cooker exploded and she was blasted into a country that did not exist in history - the Jin Dynasty. There, Lin Wu Niao transformed with a single shake, becoming the recommended chef of the imperial kitchen's first chief manager, the imperial Lin kitchen.

Without even the slightest bit of culinary talent, Lin Wu Niao had no choice but to toughen up and participate in the selection for the imperial kitchen. Relying on five packs of instant noodles and a stick of Maybelline lipstick, she smoothly got chosen.

After entering the emperor's palace, handsome men and beautiful cuisine became the modern-day Lin Wu Niao's romantic undertaking, a double harvest. Not only did she harvest the love of the mensao kitchen chief, she also obtained the title of the first in the palace hall's imperial chefs.

Yet, because of the ambiguousness of the chief manager of the imperial kitchen, Miao Man Xi, she was drawn into an inner court rebellion. On one side, a beautiful man. On the other, a beautiful career. At the end of the day, which one should she conquer?

Hair-raisingly hilarious, the crazy lady chef decisively battles the imperial palace with the powerful beauty of the kitchen-blind. She challenges the imperial kitchen with pots, bowls, ladles, baisins; battling to the summit.
